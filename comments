Code organization: The code is well-organized and easy to read. You have defined two functions for generating 8-bit and 12-bit passwords, respectively. You have also added docstrings, which is great.

- [ ] Error handling: You have used a try-except block for handling exceptions, which is good. However, the error message displayed to the user is not very helpful.You can improve the error message to indicate what went wrong and provide suggestions for the user to fix it.

- [ ] Variable names: Variable names are self-explanatory and easy to understand. However, you can consider renaming split_address to something more meaningful, such as octets or ip_octets.

- [ ] User interface: The user interface looks clean and simple. However, you can consider adding some error handling for invalid input, such as non-numeric characters, invalid IP address format, or out-of-range values.

- [ ] Testing: You can consider adding some test cases to ensure that the functions are working as expected. You can use a testing framework such as unittest or pytest to automate the testing process.

Overall, the code looks good and well-structured. With some minor improvements in error handling and testing, it should be ready for deployment.
